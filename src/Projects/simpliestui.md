## What is simpliestui?
`simpliestui` is a lightweight and clean CSS microframework/design system. It was created out of my need for a design system that allows me to describe how things **look**, while letting me write CSS to decide **where** things should appear.

---

## What features simpliestui?
`simpliestui` provides basic utility colors, components, and sizes, which are consistently applied across all components.

This website is written using `simpliestui`, all buttons, text and colors (press F12, you'll see).

## Why should you use it?
`simpliestui` is highly inspired by [SkeletonCSS](http://getskeleton.com/), primarily for its philosophy rather than its look and feel, which led me to write my own. It's basically ultra light (less than 400 lines!), production ready for any of my tools and provides a developer experience tailored.

It also does **not** runs on everything, and by that I mean that you dont need anything to make it work, it's not a preprocessor or a library, just a classic and basic CSS file. No complex NodeJS stack or modern JS tooling is needed to use it. Serve it over HTTP, and start using it. 

It may not suits everyone needs, but you really should give it a try [here](https://code-nuage.github.io/simpliestui/).
